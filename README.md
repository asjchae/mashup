What I have so far:

* The ability to add movies.
* The ability to relate a movie to a set ID.

Where I'm stuck:

* Finding movies that pre-exist in the database in order to add set IDs to them.

What I need to do after that:

* The ability to search for movies related to a set ID.

What I have so far:

* You can add movies to sets and sets to movies.

Where I'm stuck:

* When I try to display all the movies in alphabetical order, the ones with more set IDs come out on top. (I'm not going to bother with this until after I get other things working, though.)

What I need to do next:

* Displaying movies that also appeared in the set!

What I have so far:

* You can add movies to sets and sets to movies.
* You can retrieve all the _ids of the movies in a movie set.

Where I'm stuck:

* I can't actually get the Movie object from the _id.

What I need to do next:

* More callback functions to get all the way down to compiling a list of movies that are related to the set that the user inputted? OMG brain explosion.
